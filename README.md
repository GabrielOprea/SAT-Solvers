# SAT-Solvers
2 SAT Solvers implemented in Python, using 2 different algorithms to solve the NP-Complete problem. The first is based on a matrix representation and backtracking, the second stores the expression as a binary tree, where the leaves represent the expression with all the literals substituted to either true or false.
